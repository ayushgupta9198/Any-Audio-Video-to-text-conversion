Today show me decides to chancellor angela merkel in this sunday's election. You know i started to photograph angela mad to 1991 benji chest enter the political arena you know photography. Couple gift sets out to shoot politicians throughout their career is to record how high office change them physically. Navigate to mini direction on how to pose but simply place them in front of a white background she was looking up to the camera i remember that she was a bit awkward. And shy but even so she was an experience i was impressed by her strings. Energy power. Linda was a fast if i scrap medicals trademark hand gesture. In 1998. She showed the first time the famous merkel diamond. And why she did it and you know you keep your sums together automatically your shoulders get up. And you can stand for long time. And listening maybe boring speeches attentive because your body never get too relaxed. And in recent weeks the pad map for the final photoshoot of course she changed. If your chancellor for 16 years. Static. Glow in her eyes. Goodness in the eyes disappeared. Bunchie. Kept her personality. And she always had her ego in check. Normally politician tied to control the images. But she didn't ask. For approval their pictures. I sued for cynthia's out any control from her side. Yeah she didn't make a show for the camera. Teacher said okay that's me. On sunday i'm going to buckle steps down as chancellor and germans will go out to vote to replace deleted ave come to know as multi. The mother of the nation from the guardian on machine iqbal today in focus is long johnson ship comes to an end what next pajama day. Kate connelly. You're the guardian and the observer spelling correspondent. Mckenzie used longest-running national leader for a whopping 16 years. What is the secret to success. Yes so it is quite amazing she will have been one of the longest-serving german leaders as well and i've had it said in recent days as people have been idolizing this very question it's the she doesn't get offended very easily so she's not been set back by criticism towards her of which this been a lot over the years. She's managed to take lost ways that the german election who won voting for the cd you before. And move this conservative posse don't just to the sentence some would say even said of almost to the left. Success is down to a consensus building a statue that she's had the centrist attitude that you get the impression of his woman quite a shy woman who is slowly made her way up on the back of being somebody who really does her homework and it was a quiet and unassuming character i think somebody who maybe was always underestimated. Take a step back can you tell us what did she inherit when she did become chancellor in 2005. Well we had just have the era of gas shrode it was a very interesting arridy headed the social democrats in the coalition with the green posse. David estes the major thing that he did when he was in power with a series of reforms that top back drastically on germany's generous welfare benefits very controversial still holds the social democrats to this day and it led to thousands of people protesting in the streets and. And he hasn't had a female leader before and i think it was a quite a lot more of a conservative place than it actually is now it was not a place where it was obvious for that to be a female leader as feminist. What you think she shied away from identity and what did she actually do practically to advance gender equality in germany. Receive more than 60% of your pay while you're on maternity leave and that was also able to be split between males and females so it has encouraged. Momentum to take that time has enabled women to. Go back into the workplace aaliyah if they so wished. I think it's supposed to be. In my mind for my own experience of having benefited from it one of her most feminists at the policy-making question quotation for michael herself and she says i have the impression the fact that i'm a woman. Plays a big role for lots of people but for myself it doesn't play much of a role because i only know myself as a woman. Stop safari mccluske way of looking at it. So i now have to ask how would you sum up our approach what defines a political leadership so i'd say yes to pragmatism the down-to-earth know she has things in her head that she's able to pull out in that moment. She has an ability to not get flummoxed and quite often has said to be down to this science background that she has no trying to trying to tackle about the political changes she's had that if they were scientific question that definitely has an answer to it was just thinking of us. She's seemed to you and see if market shopping and enjoys loki walking holiday. How much does that define hypothetical brands like what is miraculous and she's done that deliberately i mean is that when she left her first husband and it was during the gdr and she took the washing machine with her. And i think one of the interesting things about macular that she wasn't necessary taking that seriously at home until she stops hits shining on the international stage and for me some of the defining moments have been how she has dealt with a roomful of world leaders who account agree on something and she's literally through. Pull the trash together said that these people will sit down and talk doesn't want to eat go to get in the way that she's had an interesting relationship with the world leaders there's bushwalking over he's reaching in. He's about to grab her he's rubbing her neck. She's grimacing that is the chancellor of germany disengaging herself from the president of the united states. And that's my friend. Transformer by magazine i didn't even give me the man of the year the person of the year they should have they gave it to a woman who's not done the right thing in german it's not doing too well over there. Angela hair on. The lost if your 22 visits that you made. Into the uk mule 16 years is john cena. I think that germans did like the fact that she would in the very sort of felt about people and often that may be reflected what germans felt about them like her exasperation over the future when she rolled her eyes. She just can't hide her disapproval or her exasperation sometimes i think that has 100 questions also affection. What ultimately has defined slime is made of. Let's take a closer look at her record at dating with some of these crises starting with yours and in 2009 which so countries. Crippled with a spiraling dad it threatened the unity of europe itself. How did she handle that she became the symbol of fiscal austerity of and she prescribed these sweeping budget cuts and tight controls. So the chronic debts that had piled up in southern europe in a show of unity the leaders of germany and france have a great on the new plan to leave the eu out of its debt crisis the proposal involves amending eu treaties to impose stricter budget deficit rules on member governments. And she also took his very critical approach to southern europe's attitude towards these debts effectively saying you know why should they be responsible for bailing out these countries has gathered outside the parliament determined to hold empty. But. Then quite suit she recognized germany have to be the leader in that. When is oprah naked. Yes yours with claps and she said it's still available. Until i thought the whole bout that stuff nice position your lapses that was very clear to her so she then became quite quickly this driving force behind the eu's efforts to restore confidence in the euro. And this resilience that she showed brewers help to boost her popularity at home now there's a consensus in germany's it's germany actually has benefited from the euro crisis because of the way the payments were made. So there's also love supremes christeson. But i think that's immacle that was a very significant moment and then they comes another. Fruteria crossland through to turkey across this final stretch. Alyssa zimmerman. They reach europe. I'm supposed to curity if we look at immigration at the very high of the refugee crisis in 2015. Knuckle famously said. We can do this. And she open the gym and borders 205 a million refugees. How does that look for him now he's 6 years old that remark cuz you said. Awesome. we can manage this. that's the defining slogan of her career and it has been a huge effort and it was fascinating to see all of us unfold. How initially makeovers accused of being insensitive she mess up a girl who had been waiting for years to have residency in germany. Is vicky evil. And makalapa to be quite insensitive told her it was a moment was captured on television dental. Then months later it's a pet sloth pajamas if she was messing everybody in thousands of local residents have turned out to welcome the arriving migrants with a musical serenade. But. I think that's a refugee crisis. Is. Something for which she is admired and also hated it also lets quite significantly to the boost in the popularity of the far-right alternative for germany party the afd i think she would have mrs. well mistakes were made and she knew from a political point of view that what happened in 2015 could not be repeated. Leaving boca. The corner of you was fighting. so titus liminal blunt trauma.. We both watched him then comes the major health crisis that we're still dealing with for the coolster covid-19 pandemic. Look what she did michael get griffin. situation. Well it was very much seen as an issue initially that the federal state should deal with and then she quickly realized it. She needed to get the control back on that. The divorce will be set centrally and that has gone down. Quite badly several thousand people have taken to the streets of berlin to protest against the german government's auntie covid restrictions measures. In some parts of germany where people have compared the state to the east german regime. Is that not seen and felt across jeremy like that she generally did a good job. I think that it's seen a mackle took her off of other people make decisions and then realize that she had to come back in and take control because we had so many rules and all the different 16 states that became incredibly confusing and the vaccination campaign is really floundering i mean we've got something like 62% and it's been like that. And now attempts to open up the country once again but the problem is not enough people have been vaccinated but yes that the death rate is much lower head the daily infection rate right now is suicide much lower than the uk so i think that's the pandemic is something that oversee will not. I've stopped by the time she leaves pub her legacy will be measured on that as well. Many significant and immediate challenges during his 16 years as chancellor. Jamie's future ever expressed a longer-term vision of what the country might be. I think this vision idea is quite interesting i think it was helmut schmidt the fulmer jem and chancellor who said to become like those who have vision should be seen by adults so i think the idea of having a vision in germany east because of its history it's seen as something that's quite frowned upon at the same time yes you would hope and you would think that this woman who has been in power for that long would have been considering where she wants germany to go the big the big question everybody is obsessing with right now is of course the climate crisis. Germany has his commitment to become greenhouse-gas neutral by 2045 so it is how you can have that goal and you can also take business with you and also speed up some of the decision-making that's a great feeling it in germany that the obsession with detailed be a huge overblown bureaucracy it takes a huge amount of time to get very simple things done and you know if somebody has a vision it's how you can speak those things out how you can make them any more efficient bring it more into the 21st century. The big joke has been the dominant set the fax machine. The fax machine has been the main. Sing. Authorities were using to get the information no way from one place to another often quite interested me arguing that its specification protection and then sending an email at these days. Things like that have not improved. Huge problems with internet in rural areas. It does feel that this country to speak being off in the middle of europe. It should be feather on with a loss of these questions than it actually is. I think of an old of that what does the public makeover like how strong is reputation within germany. I think at a time when she is just about to leave office there's a lot of affection for her that maybe wasn't that before there's also a lot of animosity and a feeling that america has caused the country to go to sleep. Spots when you have a cigarette and a female character that plays the role who has been in this position of the decision-maker the person who has. Put the chess together who has had a hotline to vladimir putin's this person that gets things done there was a real i think some people even a fear of life of dimacale and how. Anybody can possibly step into her shoes. Coming up. Who will germany choose to replace angela merkel. Deutschland decides in just over a week's time who will be its next chancellor off of 16 years in office the outcome will also mark the start of a new era in europe's biggest economy. The election is on sunday how high the stakes and what can we expect. So on the 26th of september we will have. What has been described as one of those. Excising german election campaigns in recent years. And probably the most uncertain election that we've had school so in recent years and that's partly due to the fact that german politics is fragmented policy to have potential to get into power. And it's been so far quite volatile campaign we've had the crisis in afghanistan and before that we had the floods german politicians have described catastrophic failings in a flood warning system that failed to save the lives of about 160 people last week. That has added to the volatility of what was already isis fractious. Difficult contest about michaels influence what does that approach me for a successor. Circle the major issue that we're interested in from outside of germany but also within germany is will it be possible to have continuity if that's actually does feels me like what germans would like. Because of all these crises that that finding themselves in it feels very much like the germans don't want to experiment and. Mackerel in one of the previous election she has run in she looks into the camera at the end of one of the tv debates and said you know me and i think what is fascinating to see is that the candidates leading the fields to take over from backless jumpsuit. Twosome atleast the male candidates have gone classes on way to try and model themselves on her and some analysts even compared his demeanor to. Starting radar menasha he's the candidate from miracle zone cd potty. What's his background has many faces is a dedicated european unittest catholic. And the carnival fun has had quite a successful career but often the positions that he has been elected to the past four years he's being prime minister of north rhine-westphalia germany's most populous state. Cracking a joke. But was he going to be somebody who'd be solid enough to be jamming into the future he's a great advocate of brown coal mining which under its climate goals germany is going to have to stay away from and famously sang when the floods happened that this was not an issue that changes one's mind on climate change run climate policy. Advisor steinmeyer the president was talking about the loss of life and summing up the gravity of the situation and in the background we saw a s*** having a joke with a colleague in a lyft hub. Azle tesla and that will be the moment that sits put down to as to why omnislash it failed to become the next german chancellor. Quentin uncharismatic character and he has been very much pasta government because of course the centre-left social democrats. Have. Been in a competition with the cd ucsu for the past 8 years. And he is the finance minister the vice-chancellor. Making trips to washington so he can present himself as the statesman as somebody who is in control and power shows comes across as pragmatic and efficient in a crisis. The finance minister set-aside is customary restraint secure the needed funding germany's economy that he is a person who has. Helped to steer germany's economy through the pandemic and i think that's alyssa crucial. I have a good and clear plan for what needs to be done to make sure that we see more respect and our society. And on a magazine cover he has posed in the medical position with the rhomboid hands and it's a cheeky note to his ambition to take over from her to say you know you'll get what you want you'll get this continuity. And you've mentioned how the floods moxo telling my man in the campaign so what does that mean for the prospects of the greens candidate and then in a bed bug. At age 40 and elena has already made history she's the first candidate the greens have ever fielded for chancellor was presented by a posse as the candidate quite soon after that the policies ratings went up to 27% which is. Really great for the greens when you consider that in 2017 and they got 8% and of course boy. by the concerns about climate change. 16 for a moment with come to a moment when we as a society. Elsa country. Can make a decision. Do we carry on as usual. Or do we dare to make a real change and revitalize our country. But quite quickly at the pole racing's has slipped down and. The greens the reputation to have his being a posse of prohibition that they are wanting to find things introduce vegetarian de sopita people if i'm from eating meat. People banned from doing enough domestic flights within germany that's the reputation they have even a bad book would sell the same message social responsibility by introducing these restrictions that we will end up you know with a life that is worth living. And then on the other side of his perfection what about the role of the far-right vasd alternative deutschland party how big are they playing in this campaign. Well they've been the main opposition in the bundestag. They're likely to retain that position even though they've not made massive games in the polls than nothing brittany vidal destiny. Get back into parliament the way things look leaders of the afd have promised to ditch the european union if elected. And more recently they've mentioned the idea of add exit so the i did they would also even consider campaigning for germany leave the eu. You said this is the most important election in decades and feel the same way. And do we have a clear sense of the favor. It looks as if it will be the spd as things stand with every time i install olaf shows seems to move closer to his goal. Olaf schultz's chance of becoming chancellor of a very high right now. So i would still say that with several days still to go before the vote. That could still change we're expecting a very high voter turnout and the amounts of retirees germany's population gets ever older is higher than it's ever been before and the number of young people as a proportion of the electorate is probably i think the lowest that is ever been and i think yes germans definitely have the feeling that this is a major. Election. I suspect somebody answer this given everything that you said but. Can we expect any kind of dramatic change in german politics. I think that we will not have something traumatic what we might have which is what we had last time around is a very drawn-out. Discussion as to what the makeup of the new government will look like we will not have clara c i think on the 27th of september. Thoughts what is i think more interesting about this election and possible make the life of the new government more difficult is that it looks as if germany is going to definitely have a three-way coalition at this federal level for the first time since the 1950s. Hey you stay as long as. Can you tell me what you miss about her what you miss about covering. On this date with hours later i have to say it is really. Fascinating to watch this woman come onto the stage and it's very unassuming way to embrace the role to make it hurts to stand up tool of the happens to have been men around 2. Intellect has sarah nurse when you're talking with her on any topic has she would stand in the corridor after an interview or a briefing and talk about those things that she clearly likes and i didn't experience this but i have colleagues from german newspapers she would do quite good imitations of people who she had met say world leaders when she laughs because she.
